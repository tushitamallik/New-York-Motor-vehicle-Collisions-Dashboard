# New-York-Motor-vehicle-Collisions-Dashboard
Build interactive web applications with Streamlit and Python. Use Pandas for data manipulation in data science workflows.
• Developed an interactive data exploration web app using Python's Streamlit library using traffic data to visualize which area in the city is more prone to traffic accidents.
• Demonstrated skills in data loading, exploration, visualization, and dashboard creation.

## Objectives
1. Build interactive web applications with Streamlit and Python
2. Use pandas for data manipulation in data science workflows

To build a data science web app with the Streamlit library in Python. By the end of this project, we will use Python and Streamlit to build beautiful and interactive web apps. We are going to load, explore, visualize and interact with data, and generate dashboards.

## Project Structure
The hands on project on Build a Data Science Web App with Streamlit and Python is divided into following tasks:

1: Project Overview and Demo<br/> 
2: Turn Simple Python Scripts into Web Apps<br/> 
3: Load the Motor Vehicle Collisions Data<br/> 
4: Visualize Data on a Map<br/> 
5: Filtering Data and Interactive Tables<br/> 
6: Plot Filtered Data on a 3D Interactive Map<br/> 
7: 3D Interactive Map <br/> 
8: Charts and Histograms<br/> 
9: Select Data Using Dropdowns<br/>
